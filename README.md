🌈🎨 Day 6 Project: Color Flipper! 🖌️✨

Today, I'm thrilled to present my Day 6 project in the 30 days, 30 projects challenge: a Color Flipper! 🎉🌟

This fun and interactive app randomly generates colors with each click, providing you with a burst of vibrant hues to brighten your day. Whether you're a designer seeking inspiration or just looking for some color therapy, this app has got you covered. 🌈🖼️

The Color Flipper is created using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to dynamically change the background color.

Give it a whirl and let me know which color combinations you discover! Your feedback is invaluable as I continue to explore the world of web development. 🗣️🎨

Stay tuned for more exciting projects on this coding adventure! 🚀 #30Days30Projects #ColorFlipper #WebDevelopment
